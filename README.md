# Capstone-Project - Goergen Institute for Data Science Masters Admissions

* **Abstract**
This project uses the University of Rochester's applicants data, the National Clearinghouse data, and the school rankings data (provided by the U.S. News \& World Report) to create meaningful visualizations and plots to answer the most important questions the department wants to know. Ultimately, we convey and suggest ideas that will help raise the accepted yield of the GIDS program.
