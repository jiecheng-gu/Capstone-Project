# Goergen Institute for Data Science Masters Admissions 

## **Project Goal** 
The Goergen Institute for Data Science wants to understand the types of institutions and programs that students are choosing to attend. Thus, the goal of this project is to better understand our applicant pool and the programs that are our main competition, assist in marketing and future recruitment, and finally to predict which applicants will accept our offer. To deliver against this goal, the team employed various exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations to it easier for people of non-data science background to understand. In addition, the team used classification models such as Decision Tree, Logistic, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest to ultimately predict if admitted applicants would accept our offer. The team was able to deliver powerful and insightful recommendations to the department in potentially increasing the accepted yield of the GIDS.
